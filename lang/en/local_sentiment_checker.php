// Description.
$string['Describ'] = "About this plugin";

$string['moreinfo'] = "In order to represent the analyzed Posts in a simple and graphical way, we have created a local Plugin that can be installed on any Moodle platform. It automatically reads the database every time we use it, and displays the posts in order of modification/creation. the module reads the posts  automatically in a background process that will avoid the need to load the program to read the new posts.";

$string['moreinfo1'] = "This plugin consists of 3 parts: a form to modify parameters, a tab with the posts and one with analysis.";

$string['moreinfo2'] = "Posts The posts will be displayed in 3 different colors, depending on whether their polarity is negative, neutral or positive according to our thresholds. Also it will show the detected language, the polarity and a link to the original discussion of the post, to give more context.";

$string['moreinfo3'] = "Selection menu One of the objectives was to know the general sentiment of a course, therefore, we have also created a course selector to show only the posts of this one. As many times we will want to see what has been detected as negative, we have put a checkbox to display only these posts in the tab. As there can be problems at the time of translation, we can also make it show us this one. As we have said, the polarization goes from [-1, 1] and the thresholds of negativity and positivity are -0.3 and 0.3 respectively. The colors shown are taking into account these parameters, but we wanted to incorporate the possibility of modifying them to be more or less restrictive.";
$string['moreinfo4'] = "Analysis: We have also incorporated an analysis tab, also linked to the selector menu, which shows the overall average sentiment of the platform, and in the case of selecting a specific course, the average sentiment in the course. It also shows a pie chart of the number of charts in the different languages as well as the polarization result.";

// Regarding.

$string['regarding3'] = "The AI models selected to be used are typically trained on large datasets that have been carefully curated to ensure that they are representative and diverse.

More information can be found here: ";
$string['regarding4'] = "It's important to note that tools with enhanced functionality provided by AI models are never perfect and should be used in conjunction with human moderation and oversight.

The overall design and user interface of this tool is intended to assist human forum moderators, with final decisions left to human judgment.";
